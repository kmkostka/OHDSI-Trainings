# Community Resources

* __[The Book of OHDSI](http://book.ohdsi.org)__ – This is a book about the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative. The OHDSI community wrote the book to serve as a central knowledge repository for all things OHDSI. The Book is a living document, community-maintained through open-source development tools, and evolves continuously.
  * A few highlighted chapters:
     * Chapter 4: The Common Data Model (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html)  - an overview of the CDM conventions
     * Chapter 5: Standardized Vocabularies (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html) – where you can learn about concepts, relationships, hierarchies
     * Chapter 10: Defining Cohorts (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/Cohorts.html) – where you can learn about building cohorts in ATLAS and in R

* __[OHDSI Github: OMOP CDM Wiki](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html)__ – for those who want to know what’s captured in each CDM domain (can be useful for cohort building / querying)

* __OHDSI GitHub: [Cohort Diagnostics](https://github.com/ohdsi/cohortdiagnostics)__ and __[PheValuator](https://github.com/ohdsi/phevaluator)__  – community packages for phenotype evaluation
* __Existing OHDSI Studies: [LEGEND](https://github.com/ohdsi/legend)__  and the __[OHDSI Studies repo](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/)__  – places where you can see existing community work, you can reuse the concept sets/cohorts by importing the JSONs (under the folder: inst-> cohort) or  SQL (inst -> sql -> sql_server).
